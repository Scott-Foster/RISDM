## RISDM is an R package that provides functionality for estimating, diagnosing, predicting and interpreting Integrated Species Distribution Models. These models take data from disparate sources and utilises their best attributes whilst minimising their worst. See @fos24 for more details about the package.

## Summary

At its very base, the \texttt{RISDM} package implements the models described in [@mil19;@fle19;@isa20]. These models exploit multiple data types into a single species distribution model. Such models coherently capture uncertainty throughout the entire estimation and prediction process, unlike most approaches that consist of multiple analysis stages. The structure of code for the core function in `RISDM`, namely isdm(), evolved from that specified in @dam19.

Worked examples are presented in the \texttt{RISDM} package's vignette, as well as in [@fos24].

### Installation

The `RISDM` package can be installed using `devtools` R package.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
library( devtools)
devtools::install_github( repo="Scott-Foster/RISDM", build_vignettes=FALSE)
```

`RISDM` bases its inference on the `INLA` package. As such, an installation of `INLA` is required. This can be performed using the following code.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library( devtools)
install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),  
                INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)
```

## Funding

This work was part of The National Vertebrate Pests and Weeds Distribution project, which was partially funded by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestryâ€™s Established Pest Animals and Weeds Management Pipeline Program and Supporting Communities Manage Pests and Weeds Program.
